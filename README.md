# HourlyBikeRental-Demand
s. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs
around the world.
The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for
researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival
location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems
therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying
mobility in a city.
Problem Statement
In this project, we are asked to combine historical usage patterns with
weather data in order to forecast hourly bike rental demand.
